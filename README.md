# Election_Analysis
## Project Overview
A Colorado Board of Elections employee assigned the following tasks to complete the election audit of a recent local congressional election.

1. Calculate the total number of votes cast.
2. Get a complete list of candidates who received votes.
3. Calculate the total number of votes for each candidate received.
4. Calculate the percentage of votes each candidate won.
5. Determine the winner of the election based on popular vote.

## Resources
Data Source: election_results.csv
Software: Python 3.9.7, Visual Studio Code 1.63.2 

## Summary
The analysis of the election shows that:

There were 369,711 votes cast in the election.

The candidates were:
  
  -Charles Casper Stockham
  -Diana DeGette
  -Raymon Anthony Doane
  
The candidate results were:
  
  -Charles Casper Stockham received 23.0% of the vote, for a total of 85,213 votes.
  -Diana DeGette received 73.8% of the vote, for a total of 272,892 votes.
  -Raymon Anthony Doane received 3.1% of the vote, for a total of 11,606 votes.

## Challenge Summary
In this project, we were tasked with reporting the total votes and number of candidates in a Colorado campaign. Therefore, I generated a vote count report to caluclate the total number of votes cast and more. With the election_results.csv, I was able to import that data and get a ist of candidates and the number of votes they each received. With those two information (total # of votes and the # of votes each candidate received), I was able to get the percentage of votes for each candidate. From that calculation, I was able to determine, using Python, which candidate was the winner of the election based on popular vote.
